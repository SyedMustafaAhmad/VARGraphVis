The project aims to develop an innovative VR tool for visualizing and interacting with graphs in three dimensions (3D). This will allow researchers, academics and students with a dynamic and interactive platform to explore, and analyze citation networks and get a deeper insight into scholarly communication and knowledge dissemination. The project itself is made in Unity to enure cross-platform support.
